## Best Practices for Signal-Based Standalone Applications

### Do's ✅

#### Architecture
1. **State Management**
   - Keep state logic in dedicated services
   - Use computed signals for derived state
   - Implement state immutability
   - Use effect() for side effects

2. **Component Design**
   - Keep components focused and small
   - Use standalone components for better tree-shaking
   - Implement smart/dumb component pattern
   - Use signals for component state

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy load routes and features
   - Use trackBy with ngFor
   - Implement change detection strategies
   - Cache HTTP responses when appropriate

4. **Scalability**
   - Follow feature-based folder structure
   - Create shared modules for common functionality
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use TypeScript strict mode

5. **Maintenance**
   - Document signal dependencies
   - Write unit tests for signal logic
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Keep services single-responsibility

### Don'ts ❌

#### Architecture
1. **State Management**
   - Don't mix signals with BehaviorSubject/Subject
   - Avoid multiple sources of truth
   - Don't mutate signal values directly
   - Don't use signals for static data

2. **Component Design**
   - Don't create large monolithic components
   - Avoid deep component nesting
   - Don't mix template and business logic
   - Avoid two-way binding when unnecessary

3. **Performance**
   - Don't create unnecessary computed signals
   - Avoid excessive signal updates
   - Don't ignore memory leaks
   - Don't skip unsubscribing from observables

4. **Scalability**
   - Don't duplicate signal logic
   - Avoid tight coupling between components
   - Don't ignore TypeScript types
   - Avoid global state when unnecessary

5. **Maintenance**
   - Don't skip error handling
   - Avoid complex signal chains
   - Don't ignore code documentation
   - Avoid premature optimization
